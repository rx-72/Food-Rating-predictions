# Food-Rating-predictions

  In my previous project, I determined whether certain nutrient factors of a recipe may play a role in being significant to how a recipe is rated. I concluded that certain nutrition variables did prove to be correlated to how ratings of a recipe was given. To follow up this result, my prediction question now will be to predict the average rating that a recipe may recieve on the food website, using its available columns and my self created nutrition variable columns. In particular, the rating that a recipe may reciew according to the given data ranges between 1 - 5 (float values included). Because of this, the prediction that I will commit to will be a regression since I may have to predict decimal values for my ratings (for example, 4.606061). The response variable will be specifically the column "average_rating_per_recipe", which contains the average rating a recipe recieves out of all of its reviews. The metric I plan to use will be RMSE, since I plan to care more about prediction of the rating in this project than how each column will contribute to predictions of the average rating. Finally I look into just about every column to build my model, including submission date, number of steps, number of ingredients, description, tags, etc. Note that each column is available pre prediction for usage, so we don't have to make any assumptions about the prediction of any of the columns here, but we may need to do so for any future columns we may try to add or use. (For example, it's likely I know a recipe's nutrition and calories before prediction so we can use said columns possibly [whether they prove useful or not].)
